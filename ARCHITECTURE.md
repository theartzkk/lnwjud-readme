# Architecture

## DOMAIN TRUTH

- AWH is a local-first personal multi-project workspace hub.
- `.awh/project.json` is portable project identity and display metadata.
- `PROJECT.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, `TASKS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `DECISIONS.md` are portable Project Memory truth.
- Canonical workspace paths, local availability, and UI state are device-local.
- `.git` is local project history and is never synchronized by AWH.

## STABLE CONTRACT

- One active AWH data directory is selected by the shared resolver; consumers do not choose their own data path.
- The local Project Registry maps portable `projectId` to a canonical local workspace path and local state.
- Project identity is generated once by explicit initialization and is never derived from an absolute path.
- Filesystem reads/writes use the existing canonical workspace, secret-path, and containment guards.
- Writes remain permission-gated, bounded, and recoverable through checkpoints where applicable.
- Local QA is the source of truth for local verification; GitHub is optional.

## CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION

- **AWH Desktop:** existing sandboxed Electron Control Center and local settings flow.
- **Active data-directory resolver:** one policy for AWH/legacy compatibility and clean installation.
- **Local Project Registry:** device-local `projects.json` under the resolved AWH data directory.
- **Project manifest:** `.awh/project.json` with portable UUID, name, type, and creation metadata.
- **Project Memory:** explicit, non-overwriting portable Markdown initialization and bounded context reads.
- **Git/local history:** read-only Git status, diff, log, and local project context.
- **Filesystem/security boundary:** canonical workspace resolution, secret-path protection, and containment checks.
- **Checkpoints:** bounded local recovery manifests for guarded workspace changes.
- **Task/runtime engine:** approved task execution with bounded runtime metadata and logs.
- **Local QA:** cross-platform Node-based QA engine with machine-readable results.
- **MCP / remote-readonly AI adapter:** local stdio MCP and restricted remote-readonly profile; remote tunnel E2E is not claimed.

## FUTURE COMPONENTS

- AWH Hub API and schema.
- Device registry.
- Source revision synchronization.
- Separate assets layer.
- Creative/Remotion workspace.
- macOS packaged app.
- Real OpenAI Secure MCP Tunnel control-plane E2E verification.
